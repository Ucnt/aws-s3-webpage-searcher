Hello,

This is a test upload by @TechNerdings (https://twitter.com/TechNerdings).

If you see this in your bucket, you are allowing anyone and/or authenticated AWS users to uplaod files to your bucket.

I would recommend that you update these settings as it likely is not intended.

DM is open if you have any questions.
